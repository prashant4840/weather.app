My Web Apps

I’ve built three simple web apps using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no libraries, nothing complicated. Just open the file in your browser and it works instantly.

Apps

Atmos — Weather App

Search for any city and instantly see live weather details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a 5-day forecast. You can also tap on any forecast day to view more information, including UV index, sunrise and sunset times, and the chance of rain.
